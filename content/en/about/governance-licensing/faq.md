## Q. How do I get involved?

A. The best way to get started is to join the community, where you can contribute to the code, participate in the forums, report and track bugs and receive updates on the latest releases. We have opportunities for all kinds of contributors. Learn more about [who can contribute]({{< relref "/contributing#who-can-contribute" >}}).

## Q. How will the webOS OSE Project work?

A. We are a truly open project. You will see us working in the open like any community member, so you can see what we're doing in real time. We operate using typical open practices: the Project uses the Apache 2.0 license, is hosted on GitHub, and accepts contributions via a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) approach. As the community grows and individuals and organizations emerge who make significant contributions, it is our intention to invite them into the [governance]({{< relref "governance-model" >}}) of the Project.

In addition to hosting source code and issue tracking system on GitHub, the webOS Open Source Edition (OSE) website will host forums.  Learn more on the [forum]({{< relref "/community" >}}).

## Q. How do I see webOS OSE in action?

A. webOS OSE 1.0 is targeted at developers. Right now, you can build and run it on Raspberry Pi 3, the best development environment to easily access and test your code.

## Q. I am a web developer. How do I deploy my web application to the webOS OSE platform?

A. webOS OSE is optimized for the [Enact](http://enactjs.com) framework. You can deploy your application in the device, or bring your application for consideration within the webOS OSE distribution.

## Q. Which devices other than Raspberry Pi 3 can I port webOS OSE to?

At this point, webOS OSE can only be ported to Raspberry Pi 3. However, as webOS OSE is an open source project, it is your call to decide whether to implement webOS OSE on any other form factors.
