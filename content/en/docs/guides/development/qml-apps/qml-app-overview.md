The webOS platform supports applications developed with QML (Qt Modeling Language). These apps are executed within application containers which wrap the Qt QML engine.

QML applications can be developed using webOS QML plugins described below.

- [qml-webos-bridge](http://github.com/webosose/qml-webos-bridge): A bridge to the Luna Bus, which allows QML apps to call luna-based webOS services.
- [qml-webos-framework](http://github.com/webosose/qml-webos-framework) (also called EOS): Provides window components such as WebOSWindow.
- [qml-webos-components](http://github.com/webosose/qml-webos-components): Contains miscellaneous QML components such as PmLog, PmTrace, and FpsCounter.
