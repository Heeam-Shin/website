This page provides the summary of each Command-Line Interface (CLI) release for webOS Open Source Edition (OSE).

## v1.10.1 (October 2019)

This version is compatible with **webOS OSE 2.0.0**. See below for the new, changed, and removed features along with fixed issues and known issues in this release.

### New features

* Added a web app template that uses the WebOSSerivceBridge API
* Added a feature to check the validity of the version in `appinfo.json` when packaging an app, which checks whether each version number is 9 digits or less
* Added a guide text regarding the default target device to the CLI help

### Changed features

* Changed to show appInstallService's error text when app installation fails
* Changed the icon images generated by executing `ares-generate --template` to new images.

### Removed features

* Removed the `webOS.js` library
* `ares-inspect --service` option cannot be used with the `--open` option
* Removed EULA that appeared on CLI when executing a command for the first time, which was replaced by EULA that appears on the developer site when downloading the CLI package

### Fixed issues

* Enabled the `ares-inspect --service` option
* Fixed an issue where `ares-inspect --open` option cannot open a browser on Windows
* Fixed to create a `.ssh` directory after executing `ares-setup-device`

### Known issues

* When you install or uninstall an app using `ares-install`, a running Home Launcher disappears from the screen. To make the app listed on Home Launcher, you must reboot the target.
    - After rebooting the target, the external app is listed on Home Launcher, but the icon of the app is not displayed.

## v1.9.4 (June 2019)

See below for the new and changed features, bug fixes, and known issues in this release.

### New features

* Added a feature to check the version rule of your app when you package your app
* Added a feature to check if the app ID and app version exist in the `appinfo.json` file of your app when you package your app
* Added a feature to add read permission to all files of your app when you package your app

### Changed features

* Updated templates (changed usable webOS APIs and how to use PmLog, `appinfo.json`)
* Changed the scenario to prompt you whether to overwrite an existing folder when creating a project. Now, CLI prompts you whether to overwrite the folder as soon as you executes the `ares-generate` command with the existing folder name. In older versions, CLI prompts you when you enter your app information.
* Changed the CLI folder structure due to code refactoring

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where `ares-setup-device --reset` does not print the reset device list

### Known Issues

* This version of CLI does not support `ares-inspect --service` temporarily.

## v1.8.1 (July 2018)

### New and changed features

* Changed the package filenames (from `webos-ose-cli-rpi_sdk-*.*` to `ares-webos-cli-ose_sdk-*.*`)

* Added the end-user license agreement (EULA)

* Added a template for hosted web apps

## v1.6.4 (March 2018)

This is the first official release of CLI for webOS OSE. For a detailed list of key features, see [key features]({{< relref "cli-user-guide#key-features">}}).

### Known issues

* Web Inspector and Node Inspector work on Blink-based browsers (Chrome and Opera) but not on non-Blink browsers (Internet Explorer, FireFox, and Safari).

* The emulator should be running prior to using `ares-install` or `ares-launch` commands. CLI does not run the emulator automatically.

* `ares-server` and `ares-inspect` commands are not terminated on their own, and can only be terminated manually by pressing **Control+C**.

* `ares-package` shows an error message if an app filename contains non-ASCII characters. (App filenames should contain Latin letters ONLY.)

* `ares-setup-device --search|-s` (Search webOS Devices) is not working, because webOS OSE does not contain upnpd.
