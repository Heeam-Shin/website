On June 25, LG Electronics signed on a Memorandum of Understanding with The Qt Company to expand its collaboration on webOS.

The expanded partnership includes embedding webOS OSE in future automotive, robotics, and smart home devices as well as positioning webOS as a reference platform of Qt. The combination of Qt's expertise in user experience and LG's knowledge of products is expected to create a powerful environment for development of innovative apps and devices.
