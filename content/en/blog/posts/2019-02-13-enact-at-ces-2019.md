Roy Sutton, the manager of the Enact team in LG Silicon Valley Lab, has posted an article on his Medium blog about the Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) demo showcase held at CES 2019, calling it a success.

Describing how their front and rear seat infotainment system works, he mentioned that the Web Application Manager (WAM) component from webOS Open Source Edition enabled the use of web technologies on AGL and allowed his team to speed up the app development on desktop browsers.
